    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups bread flour, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle warm beer</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons shortening</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal, or as needed</li>
            <li>16 sticks string cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 4 cups bread flour, beer, water, shortening, yeast, brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder in the bowl
                 of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment;
                 mix until combined. With the mixer running, add remaining flour, a little at a time,
                  until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms into a ball, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Place dough into the bowl.
                 Cover with a clean towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Grease 2 pizza pans with remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil; dust with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Punch dough down gently and divide into 2 equal portions. Place each portion onto a prepared pan. Cover and let rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stretch each dough out 1 inch past the edge of the pan.
                 If dough shrinks back when stretched, cover and let rest for 5 more minutes before stretching again.</li>
            <li>Arrange 8 sticks cheese, ends touching, around the edge of 1 pan. Fold overhang over cheese and press dough to seal. Repeat with the second pan.</li>
            <li>Bake pizzas in a preheated 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) oven until the center is set and crust is crispy, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
